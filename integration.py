#Explanation
"""

✅ integration.py is ready!

It includes mock functions that simulate connecting your chatbot to:

📨 Intercom → send_message_to_intercom(user_id, message)

📲 WhatsApp → send_message_to_whatsapp(phone_number, message)

🧑‍🏫 Student Dashboard (LMS) → update_student_dashboard(student_id, update_content)

These functions are placeholders, but you can easily replace them with real API calls to Twilio, Meta Cloud API, Intercom SDK, or your university’s LMS."""
